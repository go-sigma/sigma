# Push helm chart to sigma

### Generate a sample helm chart

``` bash
helm create demo
```

This command will create 'demo' directory, and a sample helm chart in it.

``` bash
helm package demo
```

Run this command outside the 'demo' directory, and you will get a file which named 'demo-0.1.0.tgz'.

### Push the helm chart to sigma

Note: before helm version v3.13.0, it doesn't support push helm chart to OCI registry over HTTP, you must use HTTPS.
You can see the v3.13.0 [release note](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.13.0).

Before helm version v3.13.0:

``` bash
helm registry login --insecure -u sigma -p sigma 127.0.0.1:3000
helm push demo-0.1.0.tgz oci://127.0.0.1:3000/library/demo --insecure-skip-tls-verify
```

After helm version v3.13.0:

``` bash
helm registry login -u sigma -p sigma 127.0.0.1:3000
helm push demo-0.1.0.tgz oci://127.0.0.1:3000/library/demo --plain-http
```
